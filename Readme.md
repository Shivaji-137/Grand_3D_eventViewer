## This is the sample 3D Event Viewer in javascript for Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection, written by Shivaji Chaulagain
### In this project, First GRAND hdf5 data file should be converted to json file from folder " hdf5_to_json_converter". Read the information in that folder. Then, open Event_3D_viewer.html in browser, and upload the converted json file.
### * Note: If running locally, all this file should be in one folder to work.

This is the sample with all javascript code already written but css is still to be done for better looks if great look is needed otherwise this project really works. Also, there is some error in order of update of hit point. It will be solved shortly.
